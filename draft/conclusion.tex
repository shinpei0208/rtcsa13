\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented an investigation and empirical
comparison of the data transfer methods for GPU computing.
We found that the hardware-based DMA and the I/O read and write methods
are the most effective to maximize the data transfer performance for a
single stream even in the presence of competing CPU workload.
On the other hand, the microcontroller-based method is useful to overlap
the data transfer with the DMA or the IO read and write methods,
reducing the total makespan of multiple data streams.
We also demonstrated that the traditional real-time CPU scheduler can
shield the data transfer of a real-time task from performance
interference.
We believe that all these findings are useful contributions to develop
an integration of real-time systems and GPU computing.
